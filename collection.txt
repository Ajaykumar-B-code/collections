Data structure
--linear 
--non linear
Algorithms time complexity
big O it is worstcase 
theta it is specific
omega least time case

Algorithms
-Bruteforce
-searching
-divide and conquer
-Recursion 
-dp
-backtracking 
-hashing
-Randomized
------------------------------------------
if two for loops are there then the greatest will be considered as worst case 
------------------------------------------
data strucute is a type of storing data in structured way to make crud operations
linear : data is stored continous in the memory ex array,linkedlist,stack,queue

nonlinear : trees,graph,trie,bitmap
 greedy is optimal approach
recursion  print n number
backtracking n qeen
dp fibanacci series
divide and conquer merge and binart search
